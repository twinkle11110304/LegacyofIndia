    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, in a world filled with screens and notifications, a group of passionate storytellers noticed something beautiful was fading away — the rich, colorful stories of India's incredible heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children were growing up without knowing the legends that shaped civilizations, the festivals that brought communities together, or the traditions that made India a land of wonder. We saw young minds hungry for knowledge, but the stories were trapped in old books, told in complex language, scattered across forgotten pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we asked ourselves: What if we could bring India's legacy to life? What if every child could explore 28 states with just a click? What if history felt like an adventure, not a textbook? What if learning about heritage was as fun as playing a game?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's when <strong>Legacy of India</strong> was born. 🪔
    </p>
    <p>
      We're not just a website — we're a digital diya, lighting up the path to India's incredible past, present, and future. Every page you click, every quiz you take, every story you read is a step toward understanding the beautiful tapestry that is India.
